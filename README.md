# Topline integration interview project

Thanks for taking the time to interview! We really appreciate it, and we hope to see the best of your work.

## Rules

Please do this interview project on your own, without the help of anyone else.
With that being said, you are more than welcome to use the internet.
Google and Stack Overflow are invaluable tools in our daily lives, and we wouldn't expect you to do your best work without them.

We'd really like to see every part of your development process, so please _record your screen while you work_.

In addition to writing the code required by the instructions, write down your answers to the questions in the instructions directly in this README file.
Most of the questions are open ended, and you don't need to make your code handle the questions below each prompt, but please make sure your code works before moving on to the next question.
Clear writing and expressing your ideas is just as valuable as writing great code.

## Getting started

Make a fork of this repo on your own GitHub account and then clone it down to your personal computer.

- Read through the files in the `/src` directory.
- Install dependencies for the project with `yarn install`.
- Start the backend server with `yarn start` or `yarn dev` depending on whether you want the server to run in [watch mode](https://github.com/digital-loukoum/esrun#watch-mode), but note that it won't restart your server if it crashes.
- Navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser

If you have trouble, please don't hesitate to reach out to elliot@growtopline.com.

## Instructions

1. The script `/src/customer-insights.ts` correctly finds the min, max, mean, and median customer spend. However it loads every row into memory in order to determine that calculation. Change the script to calculate the min, max, mean and median if the entire customer dataset did not fit in memory.

## Tips

- The project needs some organization. Feel free to create as many files and folders as you need.
- Git is your friend. Commit often and use descriptive commit messages. Push your work to GitHub so you don't lose it.
- Get it working and then make it look good. Don't get lost in the perfect solution before you have a working solution.
- Write down your responses to all the questions in the prompt before moving on to the next prompt.
- Include more comments than you would in normal code. This will help us understand your thought process.
- Take breaks when you need them.
- You don't have to finish all of the prompts. We prefer thorough, well thought out responses over a complete solution without written responses.

## Responses
